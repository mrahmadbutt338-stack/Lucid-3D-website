## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project uses standard web technologies:

- **HTML5** — Structure of the site

✨ In addition, modern animation techniques are likely used such as:

- **CSS animations & keyframes** (for movement, fade, spin effects)  
- **JavaScript scroll and interaction triggers**  
- Possibly **3D libraries like Three.js or 3D animation helpers** for depth & interactive visuals — libraries used for creating realistic 3D effects in web browsers (e.g., WebGL powered) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
